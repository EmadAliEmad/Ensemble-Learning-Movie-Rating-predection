This is a movie recommendation system that suggests movies to users based on their preferences. The system utilizes three models: a decision tree classifier, a random forest classifier, and a gradient boosting classifier. These models are trained on a dataset of movies and user ratings. The predictions from each model are combined using an ensemble model that uses the majority voting rule to generate a final recommendation. The performance of the model can be validated using a separate validation set or by implementing cross-validation.
